# Autofill-Google-Forms
In this Project, Your excel data will be automatically filled into the Google Form and record your responses.

## Here the entry values are added to tell where the values need to be filled and you can find that, by following steps: 

* Open Google Forms
* Fill the Form but don't submit yet.
* Not right click on the forms and open Inspect menu.
* Now you have to press **CTRL + F** in the inspect menu.
* Now type **entry.**
* You will find the values you entered in the form and then copy those lines, by right clicking on it and then **copy -> Copy Element**
* Now paste those values in a excel file and then clean the data and try to make it like my excel file named **Automating Excel Sheet.xlsx**
* You can watch this video for more reference **https://youtu.be/A7U_CyhHLg8?si=aw1V42FYY9K8ulYN**
